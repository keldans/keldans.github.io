yo, i’m keldan. i started a self-directed rust crash course today. i’ve wanted to learn it for a while, and today i took the first step. i put together a syllabus to challenge myself and see how proficient i can become in 3 months.

ideally, the end goal with this crash course is to be able to write production-level rust.
