i'm disappointed with how today went. i felt distracted a lot, and didn't get the amount of work done that i would have liked. i switched gears to a non-rust project and was able to get the functionality wrapped up, but it didn't feel as fulfilling or exciting as i would have thought. i think a lot of it might have stemmed from being tired from [day 02](/day-02). tomorrow will be a better day.
