today was really frustrating. between unclear instructions and the idea vs. competence gap, i hit the wall with every lab i attempted today. it's clear that trying to push through is no longer working, so i'm hoping sleep will help me reset and see the solutions quickly in the morning.

### wins

- started all the remaining labs

### tomorrow

- wrapping all the active labs
